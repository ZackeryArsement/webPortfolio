# Summary: 

![Portfolio Wireframe](https://zackeryarsement.github.io/secondHomework/assets/images/PortfolioWireframe.png)

The web portfolio is meant to highlight my skills and provide a general summary of my background. 

The wireframe above was used as a guide through designing my html and css code.

The color theme and style of the portfolio is heavily influenced by my background in mechanical engineering and robotics. I want my portfolio to have a "mecha" style, using a dark steel grey with red and orange contrast. 

# Development:

This portfolio is meant to serve as a base of my final portfolio, only having the minimal functionalities a web portfolio should have. There is a navbar on the top of the webpage that contains my name and links to the four major sections of my page: About Me Description, Projects Completed, Future Goals and Outlook, and Contact Information.
